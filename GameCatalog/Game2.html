        <h3>IGN</h3>
        <p>"Miitopia is a cute, fun, and light-hearted RPG that puts your Miis on a grand adventure. While the gameplay is simple and repetitive, the charm and humor make up for its shortcomings." - 7.3/10</p>

        <h3>Nintendo Life</h3>
        <p>"Miitopia is a delightfully different take on the RPG genre that puts the emphasis squarely on fun. The Mii-centric setup leads to some genuinely hilarious moments, and while the gameplay may be simple, it's no less enjoyable for it." - 8/10</p>
    
        <h3>Destructoid</h3>
        <p>"While it's not going to satisfy hardcore RPG fans looking for deep mechanics, Miitopia delivers exactly what it promises - a lighthearted adventure full of personality and charm." - 7.5/10</p>
